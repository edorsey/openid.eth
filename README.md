# openidconnect.eth

A simple service that allows you login to services that don't support Metamask/web3.0 with Open ID Connect instead. Eventually, it won't be [Ethereum-only](https://medium.com/metamask/metamasks-vision-for-multiple-network-support-4ffbee9ec64d)

Will use this to hook into Keycloak to allow users to login to their account with Metamask.

## How it makes money

Allow users to pay ETH to [create an OpenID Connect client](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/guides/oauth2-clients/).
